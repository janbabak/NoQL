# NoQL Frontend

## Environment Variables

This frontend supports **both build-time (Vite)** and **runtime (Docker)** environment variables.  
The same Docker image can be reused across environments by injecting variables at container startup.

### Supported Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `BACKEND_URL` | Base URL of the backend server |
| `API_TIMEOUT_MILLIS` | API request timeout in milliseconds |

### Variable Format

#### Development (Vite)
For local development, environment variables **must use the `VITE_` prefix** so that Vite can expose them to the application:

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_API_TIMEOUT_MILLIS=40000
```

#### Docker / Runtime
When running the application inside a Docker container, environment variables **must NOT use the `VITE_` prefix**:

```env
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
API_TIMEOUT_MILLIS=40000
```

These variables are injected dynamically at container startup.

### Adding or Modifying Environment Variables

When introducing a new environment variable, the following files **must be updated**:

- `frontend/NoQL/env.template.js`
- `frontend/NoQL/src/env.ts`
- `frontend/NoQL/src/global.d.ts`
- `frontend/NoQL/.env` (for local development)

### How the Environment Injection Works

Environment variables are **resolved at runtime**, not baked into the build output.

#### `frontend/NoQL/env.template.js`
- Acts as a **template** for runtime configuration.
- Contains placeholders (e.g. `${BACKEND_URL}`) instead of real values.
- Is copied into the Docker image unchanged.
- During container startup, placeholders are replaced using:
  ```sh
  envsubst < /usr/share/nginx/html/env.template.js > /usr/share/nginx/html/env.js
  ```
- The generated `env.js` contains the final runtime configuration consumed by the frontend.

---

#### `frontend/NoQL/src/env.ts`
- Provides a **typed, centralized access point** for environment variables.
- Reads runtime variables from `window._env_` (generated by `env.js`).
- Falls back to Vite build-time variables (`import.meta.env.VITE_*`) when runtime variables are not available (e.g. local development).
- Exports a single `ENV` object that should be used throughout the application.

---

#### `frontend/NoQL/src/global.d.ts`
- Extends the global `Window` interface with the `_env_` property.
- Ensures TypeScript is aware of runtime-injected variables.
- Prevents type errors when accessing `window._env_`.

---

#### `frontend/NoQL/.env`
- Provides environment variables for **local development only**.
- Variables must use the `VITE_` prefix to be picked up by Vite.

## Frontend Docker Image

### Build Frontend Image
Builds the frontend Docker image locally.  
The image version is read from the `version` field in `package.json`.

```bash
npm run dockerBuildFrontend
```

### Build and Push Frontend Image
Builds and pushes the frontend Docker image to the registry.  
The image version is read from the `version` field in `package.json`.

```bash
npm run dockerPushFrontend
```

### Run Frontend Container

- Expose container port `80` to a desired host port
- Provide required environment variables via an env file

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 \
  --env-file ./frontend/NoQL/.env \
  --name noql-frontend \
  janbabak/noql-frontend:0.0.1
```
